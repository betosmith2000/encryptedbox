## Inspiration

Nowadays there are hacks everywhere, big companies lose our data and we can't do anything. Encrypted Box saves all data with encryption and in a decentralized manner which protects us against these damages that increasingly affect us.

## What it does

It allows you to save passwords and notes by organizing them in folders, all in an encrypted way.

## How I built it

It is developed on Blockstack ID and GAIA Storage, which allows us to have decentralized blockchain identity and decentralized storage.

## Challenges I ran into

Develop a product with a good quality and especially functional. When thinking about decentralized applications, numerous servers come to mind, although Blockstack manages this part very well.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of

Develop the application 100% in the time I set, and I liked the result quite a bit, I hope users like it too.

## What I learned

Many things I have learned in this way, from best practices when coding to creating the site together with the domain and the certificate.

## What's next for Encrypted Box

I am thinking of adding one more section, such as file storage, I already have the feature of sharing so I think it will be welcome.
